<h1>THE BEST THREE MOVIES ACCORDING TO EDEN</h1> 
<h2>My best top three movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Luther the fallen sun</h3>
<p>Great movie, great story line. It also has one of my best actors too - Idris Elba who played as the protagonist in the movie.</p>
<h3>Django</h3>
<p>One of my all time favourite. I honestly can't mention how many times i have seen this one. not only is it historical but also a great watch. action filled of course and also suspence filled.</p>
<h3>Anikulapo</h3>
<p>Great movie, has a lot of mral lessons too. 10/10 would recommend</p>
